abstract = {Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a thriving area of scheduling research, which has been concerned and studied widely by scholars in engineering and academic fields. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the types and models of JSSP, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a review paper on this aspect up to now. The main purpose of this review is to help researchers and scholars outlining an overview of existing JSSP models and exploring more valuable research directions. We first analyze and classify the entities and their attributes, assumptions, basic subtypes, and measures of performance of JSSP based on the researches from mid-1960s to 2020s. The general representation and overview of JSSP models are also presented. Then, some extensive statistics and analysis are conducted on 297 published papers in 72 journals ranging between 2016 and early 2021. Finally, some hot research aspects of JSSP models are reviewed in detail and some promising research directions are provided.}
